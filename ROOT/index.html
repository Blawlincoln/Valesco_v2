Hailing from the city of Bleiburg, a quaint valley town nestled among the forested mountains of southern Austria, producer Valesco has worked diligently to hone his unique sound and represent his home country through music. Over the last two years, three of his original tracks have accumulated over 50 million collective plays on the Youtube channel of immensely popular outlet Trap Nation.
“Stay With Me,” an optimistic and minimal hybrid track, seamlessly blends influences from both the future bass and trap realms and results in a warm and easily approachable swayer praised by thousands of his loyal listeners. The song was featured by MrSuicideSheep as well as Trap Nation, and currently sits at a more than comfortable 10 million plays on Youtube. Valesco’s next single, “Cloud 9,” was premiered by Trap Nation as a euphoric and uplifting continuation of his beautiful, well-received saga of originals. With bubbling, bouncing synth sweeps and striking vocal chops, the song’s 20 million play count comes as no surprise.
In the coming months, as Valesco’s global influence and body of work expand even further, he hopes to embark towards the live show circuit, where he’ll have the chance to meld his own creations with some of his favorite inspirations into a deadly and inclusive performance.
